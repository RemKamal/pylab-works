1. Main Objectives
1. Provide world-class service to our customers and clients every time
This summer, I led the Opportunistic Close (OPPCA) algorithm to its release in production. We are now offering selected clients an opportunity to execute their close auction orders at a more favorable price. With our Barclays clients at the center of all we do, the goal is to allocate a certain number of shares from the close auction to the continuous session. We do this when we observe that the close auction is highly imbalanced, as keeping all the client's shares in the auction would cause extra market impact.
To provide clients with a better alternative, shares over a certain allocation threshold are executed via TARG (DARK) orders during the continuous session. This includes a "plan B" option of allocating un-executed shares back to the close auction if the execution doesn't happen or TargetClose liquidity is insufficient. This provides clients with the opportunity to get a price much better than the close auction. Clients benefit directly on their orders, and Barclays benefits from an improved product and subsequent higher flow—not only for OPPCA, but presumably for all other trade algorithms as well. This directly meets the company's goal of balancing short-term and long-term considerations in our client relationships.
After a few months of performance testing and data collection (a key focus in Q2), we recently released several versions of Opportunistic Close experiments, which improved performance even further. One of these experiments focuses on triggering OPPCA orders shortly after the imbalance is published (200ms for NASDAQ, 600ms for NYSE). Future iterations will benefit even more from imbalance-triggered executions, avoiding extra latency.
For the CapComm (Capital Commitment) project, my work consisted of three pieces:
'Opportunity to Close CapComm': I completed the original research for this and then trained the Product team on how to use it and manage additional modifications. It's focused on giving the CRB team the opportunity to internalize certain orders directly, instead of sending them to the market. This provides an extra benefit to the CRB (run by Pranay) and strengthens our collaboration on all other CapComm-related projects. This perfectly matches the management goal of increasing cross-team collaboration on our equity floor.
'Mid-Price POV CapComm': By giving our clients a mid-price execution, we directly save them the spread value. By focusing on flow that provides strong reversion and giving this flow to the CRB team, we provide an additional benefit to another team on our equity floor. For POV orders, Phase 1 research was completed and well-received by the CRB team.
'VWAP CapComm': This project had two phases. Phase 1 included VWAP orders with a CRB filter stipulating no facilitation after 3:50 p.m. That research was completed and also showed good reversion. Since most VWAP orders are either day-long or executed at the end of the day, we had to think about what else could be done for 'Mid-Price VWAP CapComm.' This is where I started Phase 2 (a Q3 focus), focusing on late VWAP orders. This is currently in progress, and I am checking markouts for T+1 and T+2 days.
All in all, with clients and the CRB at the center of this project, per Barclays' recommendation, I focus on outcomes that benefit all parties in the short- and long-term.

2. Have precision in our operations, risk management and controls
For both Opportunistic Close (OPPCA), CapComm, and previous projects, I always take risk management seriously. I always remember Buffett's quote: you can miss a little profit by being 10% slow, but you will miss 100% profit if you're wrong.
So I always double or triple-check results, especially for high-importance projects like OPPCA, which was a feature built completely from scratch and had never existed at Barclays. During the implementation phase, not all existing Algo Stack frameworks were a perfect fit to construct Opportunistic Close without ad-hoc hacks. This was one reason I closely monitored latencies (due to ORP), order arrival vs. trigger times, and whether executed orders were properly placed back to the Close auction. I spotted numerous instances where this wasn't the case, and at this point, all those issues have been resolved.
For the CapComm project, it is very easy to make a mistake in filtering out one of a few dozen filters that must be implemented due to the specific rules for flows that the CRB team doesn't facilitate. If the flow had any toxicity, it could worsen the overall results. Thus, I was meticulously careful, analyzing what each filter does to the data, why it is needed, and if any could be relaxed.
It's always a balance between relaxing filters to enlarge the dataset (which helps reduce uncertainty) and the risk that flows of a different nature will destroy the signal, thus undermining what could be a good project. Understanding this, I double-checked all results using various metrics, cut-flow shuffle exercises, and other tests to minimize risk. Therefore, when clients agree to participate in CapComm and the CRB team partners with us, I can be confident we have maximized the probability that both parties will be happy, benefiting the clients, our equity floor, and my team.

3. Focus on businesses and projects where we can excel
Both Opportunistic Close (OPPCA) and CapComm are examples of projects where we can excel. Very few brokers offer anything similar to OPPCA. This distinction helps attract clients to this algorithm in the short-term and, in the long-term, encourages clients to partner with us for other algorithms as well.
For CapComm, my analysis—done with careful checks and a focus on proper filtering—ensures that the reversion the CRB team will see is strong, statistically significant, and economically meaningful. I can say CapComm is another project where we can excel.
POV CapComm is an example of the good notional and P&L numbers that can be achieved even without a modeling approach.
Close CapComm is an example of how OPPCA can be extended to CapComm, benefiting from reusing many of the same core components.
Finally, VWAP CapComm is an example of thinking outside the box. By questioning and removing one of the filters (no facilitation after 3:50 p.m.), we can bring in significantly more notional and P&L.
I treated the limitation on VWAP CapComm orders (must be executed prior to day-end) as an issue, because the economic value was a fraction of what POV CapComm could offer, yet VWAP orders have much more notional. I identified this as a root-cause issue to be fixed. After discussing with my manager, Song, and the Product team, we agreed, removed this filter, and decided to focus on a different type of markout.

4. Drive simplicity and efficiency, seek out every opportunity to automate
Opportunistic Close (OPPCA) is an example of a streamlined product that was subsequently leveraged by CapComm, creating a new product called 'Close CapComm' which is currently going to production. By using a simple method of filtering on imbalance size to guarantee certain market impact at the close, and reusing this same methodology for Close CapComm, I showed how simplicity and removing complexity helped us get the second project done in less than half the time.
For CapComm in particular, the POV results were obtained with a simple, non-model-based approach where we removed the first quartile of the participation rate (natural for POV) and the first quartile of the impact proxy (definable for any algorithm). Thus, when I started working on VWAP CapComm, the impact proxy was repeated similarly. Although participation rate isn't explicitly defined for VWAP, I calculated it using eligible market volume during the VWAP execution. This allowed me to re-apply the same methodology of removing the first quartile of very low participation.
Not surprisingly, the values for both algorithms are close (around 2.5%). This strengthens the case that simplicity and abstraction—reusing projects by putting them "through the same denominator"—can do wonders for efficiency. It also highlights why product standardization is so important at Barclays.

5. Promote diversity of thought, champion new thinking and challenge the status quo
For every project since I joined Barclays, including Opportunistic Close (OPPCA) and CapComm, I have always challenged the status quo of what should be done first and what the final goal is. I have almost daily conversations with my manager, Song, where we debate the best, simplest, and most optimal solution given our resources, technical constraints, and current needs.
For development improvements, I discuss points with the QD team (Suraj and Pranith). For product aspects, I discuss with Bharath from the Product team, who is highly knowledgeable about the products on our ET desk. Last but not least, I actively keep an eye on current academic research, books, and practitioner conference materials. This has a tendency to bring innovation when experience alone is not enough. All of this is done to ensure the projects I deliver are done to the best of our abilities, with Barclays clients at the center.
OPPCA has already had several continuous improvements. After the next phase ('continuous-to-close' direction) is done and OPPCA in Hydra is fully supported, I plan to focus on more fundamental research areas for OPPCA. This would allow us to scale, not only due to a new direction, but also by achieving a higher trigger rate or more timing opportunities. As of now, we do not allow late orders (after 3:50 p.m.), but we can consider this in the future, as well as other improvements focusing not just on the value of the imbalance, but its change in size and velocity (change in size over time). Other inputs could include signals from other algorithms; for example, if an enhanced placement signal after 3:50 p.m. shows a benefit, we should trigger.
For the CapComm project, including late VWAPs and modifying how we measure markouts is a direct example of new thinking that brings improvements (increasing Notional and P&L) for almost no additional cost. This project involves my manager (Song), the Product team, and the QD team. I exchange ideas, listen to proposals, and deliver my own message, backed by data and economic logic. I believe this interaction provides the best outcomes: a simple, robust product that our clients—and in the case of Mid-Price CapComm, the CRB team—will value.

2. Values and Mindset
1. Mindset Challenge: Challenge the Status Quo
For Opportunistic Close (OPPCA), for CapComm, for my previous projects, and especially in my previous career, I have always challenged the status quo because that's the only way to improve the product. At times, the environment makes it hard to speak up, but I still do it because I think it is necessary and right.
Almost daily, I talk to my manager, Song, about items I want to understand better or wonder why they are done in a particular way that seems less logical to me. This also applies when other team members ask for my advice on statistics or market microstructure. They may want to know if there are other ideas that can be applied—ideas that are either new or are well-established but not widely known in literature, perhaps only by certain practitioners. I think it's a clear demonstration that I always try to think about improvement and can offer alternative viewpoints that sometimes yield equal, or even better, results.

2. Mindset Drive: Take Personal Responsibility
I always operate with precision and manage risks proactively. I believe in the short term, this helps us deliver high-quality results, and in the long term, it helps us avoid being distracted by bugs and maintenance, allowing us to focus on bigger goals.
I believe Opportunistic Close (OPPCA) is a good example where I constantly collaborated with Bharath from the Product team and Pranith and Suraj from the QD team to get things done. I was writing not just the specs, but documents explaining how certain things should be derived, why they are the way they are, and the key takeaways for the QD team so they knew exactly what to code in the Algo Stack framework.
I almost always highlight the negative aspects of every project. It's my responsibility to know if they are present and what causes them, and to get people's attention so we can allocate resources to resolve them promptly.
CapComm is another project where I take personal responsibility. Historically, communication with the CRB team can be challenging. I took responsibility for delivering the research directly to the head of the CRB team (Pranay), making sure he understood the benefits and felt assured that we had a clear plan, managed the risks, and had a path for delivery. Of course, the same presentation could be delivered by the Product team, but I advocated to do it myself because the first presentation needs to set the stage and give the most positive impression. This is more proof that I take Barclays' advice on an ownership mentality seriously.

3. Mindset Empower: Inspire Each Other to Deliver
I always support other team members. That's why, as they have told me, they are happy to talk to me, even if another team member might be more familiar with a specific feature. When I share knowledge with junior colleagues or peers, I follow a three-step pattern:
First, I try to understand what they've done and question them on particular items to lead them to the answer themselves, as this is the best way for them to learn.
Second, I share that it's okay not to know everything. Many people create a fake aura of being experts, but what worked for me in physics and allowed me to get world-level awards is being honest about what I know and what I don't. This lets me work harder on things I know less about and more narrowly on things I know well. When they talk to me, they are comfortable being honest, and we quickly find a solution because it's a friendly conversation, not a high-pressure session.
Lastly, as this is my third company, each with different responsibilities, I bring a vast amount of knowledge. This usually helps find patterns between the problem they are trying to solve and a known solution from statistics or the scientific community, which we can then adapt.
I am always happy to help junior members of the QR team, such as Yifan, our new joiner Hudson, our intern Claire, and Ameya. Sometimes Arun from the Product team will ask me about microstructure or how things were done on the buy-side. Suraj from the QD team always tries to understand things deeper to find a better implementation. And of course Ameya (QR) and Bharath (Product), who also often need input on how things are done on the buy-side (e.g., the recent project on frequent unbans from certain clients).
Additionally, Daniel and Krishan from the Product team sometimes ask me statistics-related questions. They know what they need to do, but something may not be yielding the expected results, and I have provided them with good pointers for improvement.
Last, I always try to inspire people to read more and talk to colleagues so they can build fundamental knowledge. In the current data-science world, everyone is centered on data, but history shows that 30-sigma statistical fluctuations can happen. Having knowledge of the underlying theory helps avoid not only data biases but also researcher bias—the problem of trying to prove something based on a small data size. It's much harder to disprove a sound theory that works across asset classes or is part of modern market microstructure.

4. Values Respect: Trust Those We Work With
There is always a fine line between trust and ownership. As owners, we want to check every detail, but when we have equal contribution, it's very important to trust colleagues. This allows us to move faster and rely on each other's strengths.
In terms of recent projects, after checking the underlying principles and a few sample numbers in Hudson's (QR) work on the close market impact model, I could completely trust his results. This helped me integrate his numbers and adjust them for Opportunistic Close in a single day, rather than spending a week validating everything. Because of my attention to risk and accuracy, most people never even check my numbers, knowing I've done it multiple times. This saves their time and, most importantly, my time, as I don't need to have separate conversations; they take the numbers as-is.

5. Values Integrity: Operate with Honesty
I always operate with honesty and transparency since: A) It's a part of my origin; B) It's a part of my background; C) I believe it's the only right way to do things; D) This is the standard I always follow for myself; and E) There is nothing more important to me than my reputation—it takes years to build and one second to lose. As I mentioned before, I equally highlight all the negatives and positives of each project. I raise concerns, and I celebrate success, especially when I know we can carry that success into the future with the proper work ethic.

6. Values Service: Serve Clients at the Center of What We Do
An example of how I care about clients is my first question during the CapComm meeting with the Product team. I asked how exactly our clients would benefit (getting mid-price instead of far-price) and how the CRB team would benefit. I see the CRB team as an internal client, and it's equally important that our equity floor benefits as a whole. This project allows us to serve both our external clients and our internal CRB partner. Only after that did I ask how our team would benefit. In this project, all three parties benefit, and that's why I believed Mid-Price CapComm is a great project for me to work on.

7. Values Excellence: Set High Standards
I always set high standards for our projects and try to come up with the best solution. In my spare time, I deeply follow various other quantitative fields and their innovations. When I start a new project or see how things are done at our ET desk, I always ask myself, and at times run by my manager Song, if we can use a more modern tool to achieve a better result or more results with the same energy.
Separately, for resource allocation, I often run heavy data queries or computations on Friday evenings. This allows me to benefit from abundant resources on the KDB cluster or Linux machines, so when I come in on Monday morning, the numbers are already crunched and ready for analysis.

8. Values Stewardship: Praise Sustainability
Pretty much all we do in our ET team is improving current frameworks, either because some parts are outdated or because clients ask for a particular improvement. The passion for leaving things better than we found them is already baked into the whole group's approach, including research, development, and product.
When I previously worked on certain recalibration projects involving statistical methodologies, I was keen to improve them given that much more data and modern methods are available in 2025. Given tight priority lists, we decided not to work on those model improvements, but the recalibration itself brought in new coefficients and patterns from the recent market. We completed it and improved performance versus what we were getting using old coefficients from more than a year ago.

9. LEAD: Listen and Be Authentic - Make Our Colleagues Feel Valued
As I previously mentioned, psychological safety and the absence of fear of being judged are demonstrated weekly when more junior colleagues or peers talk to me. This is despite me working with the Algo Stack for only one and a half years, while other team members have been at Barclays, or other companies, for much longer.
Being able to easily accept negative feedback is another point I take seriously. If the feedback is rational, I am often the one initiating the discussion, because I am my own hardest critic. Having an attitude of "I may not know it now, but I'll do my best and figure it out" is something colleagues see in me, and it's an attitude I share with them.
This includes Daniel and Krishan from the Product team; all junior QRs (Yifan, Hudson, Claire, Ameya); interns; and Pranith and Suraj from the QD team, who often want to know the details behind the QR logic to implement a solution more efficiently.

10. LEAD: Energize and Inspire - Set Ambitious Plans for Your Team
In our team, our directors set the stage for everyone's projects, but the devil is in the details. I often discuss statistical methods or how to achieve a desired output with our junior quants. Every day, I come to work to do a great job, solve business-important problems, have fun with my team working on those solutions, and motivate all of us to be better.
Given my previous career working with complex models, I have seen hundreds of ways to innovate and introduce next-level features. Sometimes, in a respectful, scientific debate, my manager Song has to pull me back and ask me to simplify things because not all items can be implemented in Wasp in the near future, or they would take too many resources.
I have heard from management that, at times, it can be difficult to grow talent internally or that some VPs just follow directives without proposing innovations. I have never had such a problem. Quite the opposite, I am often full of new ideas and have multiple innovation items ready. They only need a slight tweak with respect to current priorities and system capabilities. That's why I think my manager, Song—who has 15 years of sell-side experience—and I are such a great tandem.
I believe the more time I spend with our algos, the more knowledge I will acquire. My inner desire for innovation, combined with my deep previous experience in modeling, statistics, and high-performance computing, is what will set me, my manager, and my team up for future success. As I get more familiar with the system, my experience with methods that can help us scale laterally, as well as my deep knowledge of cutting-edge methods that help us improve at a depth level, are the two main reasons why my contributions will only grow. Many teams face times when marginal improvements are no longer enough, and there aren't many people who can propose practical innovations that are also based on sound theory.

PART 1: Main Objectives

1. Provide world-class service to our customers and clients every time
This summer, I led the production release of the Opportunistic Close (OPPCA) algorithm. We offered select clients the opportunity to execute their Close auction participation at more favorable prices by reallocating a portion of shares—initially designated for the Close auction—into the continuous session. This was particularly effective when imbalance levels indicated that full participation in the Close auction would result in unnecessary market impact.
The OPPCA logic allocates shares above a certain imbalance threshold to be executed as TARG (DARK) orders during the continuous session. If those shares don’t execute, they are redirected back to the Close auction, serving as a built-in safety net. This provides clients with the potential to receive better pricing, while Barclays benefits from increased product usage and flow—not just in OPPCA, but likely across our entire algo suite.
This effort aligns directly with Barclays’ goal to balance short- and long-term client relationships. After several months of data collection and testing, we launched performance-enhancing variants of OPPCA. One key improvement was triggering orders shortly after the official imbalance publication—at just 200ms for NASDAQ and 600ms for NYSE—ensuring faster market response and better outcomes. Future iterations of OPPCA will further reduce latency by incorporating imbalance-triggered logic with zero additional delays.
For CapComm (Capital Commitment), I contributed across three phases:
Close CapComm: I conducted original research and educated the Product team on its logic and implementation. This design allows three-year orders to be directed to CRB instead of the open market, thereby benefiting CRB (Barclays’ internal Central Risk Book) and strengthening broader equity desk collaboration—an important top-down goal from management.


Mid-price POV CapComm: Here, clients benefit from executions at mid-price, capturing the spread. By identifying flows with strong reversion potential and routing them to CRB, we generated further value for internal stakeholders. Phase 1 research was completed and well received by the CRB team.


VWAP CapComm: The first phase analyzed VWAP flows where CRB typically doesn’t facilitate trades after 3:50 PM. After confirming reversion opportunities, I proposed a second phase targeting late VWAP flows, with T+1 and T+2 markout evaluations underway. Given that VWAP orders often carry significant notional value, expanding coverage beyond prior facilitation filters could generate substantial P&L.


In all phases, I’ve ensured our clients—and in the case of CapComm, our CRB partners—remain at the center of what we do, in full alignment with Barclays’ strategic focus on sustainable, client-first innovation.

2. Have precision in our operations, risk management and controls
Throughout OPPCA, CapComm, and prior initiatives, I’ve maintained a strict focus on risk management. I’m guided by Buffett’s principle: “You can miss a little profit by being 10% slow, but you lose 100% if you’re wrong.” This mindset drove me to double- and triple-check critical aspects, especially for OPPCA, a feature built entirely from scratch at Barclays.
Due to the novelty of the product, our existing algo frameworks were not an exact fit. I closely monitored the first few months of latency metrics—specifically, the order receive time, trigger time, and whether fallback logic correctly sent unexecuted shares back to the Close auction. I spotted multiple inconsistencies, all of which have now been resolved.
CapComm implementation also required careful diligence. CRB uses strict facilitation filters—often dozens—and even a minor error in applying or omitting one can distort results or introduce flow toxicity. I carefully evaluated each filter’s impact on the dataset, balancing statistical robustness (larger samples) with signal preservation (avoiding noise). I performed multiple sanity checks, shuffle exercises, and alternative metric evaluations to ensure resilience. This gives us and our CRB partners high confidence that any agreed-upon CapComm flow is well-understood and mutually beneficial.

3. Focus on businesses and projects where we can excel
OPPCA and CapComm are both differentiated products. Few brokers globally—perhaps countable on one hand—offer functionality equivalent to Opportunistic Close. That positions us well to attract new flow, and opens the door to cross-sell additional algorithms.
CapComm offers another area of strategic excellence. Our POV CapComm approach generated strong notional and P&L results without needing a formal model. Close CapComm benefits directly from OPPCA infrastructure, showcasing effective reuse of internal technology. VWAP CapComm, particularly the late VWAP variant, emerged from questioning whether the 3:50 PM filter was necessary. By relaxing it, we unlocked larger volumes and increased economic significance.
Treating this as a root-cause issue, I consulted with my manager Song and Product, and we agreed to reframe the logic. This decision allowed us to bring in significantly more flow. CapComm exemplifies how rigorous, economically grounded thinking can lead to projects where Barclays can lead and deliver high-value results.

4. Drive simplicity and efficiency; seek out every opportunity to automate
OPPCA is a clear example of a streamlined product that’s now foundational for Close CapComm. A simple imbalance filter—used to estimate Close auction market impact—proved effective enough to support both products, reducing time to deployment and complexity.
In POV CapComm, I achieved strong results using a non-model-based approach: removing the bottom quartile of participation rate (natural for POVs) and the bottom quartile of impact proxy. This same logic was then adapted for VWAP CapComm, even though participation rate isn’t defined for VWAP by default. I computed it using eligible market volume and reused the same quartile-cut logic.
The fact that both POV and VWAP flows converged to similar thresholds (~2.5%) reinforces the value of abstraction and reusability. This not only saved development time, but also validated our framework’s extensibility. Simplicity, when built on sound logic, often leads to higher efficiency and product standardization—goals strongly encouraged at Barclays.

5. Promote diversity of thought; champion new thinking and challenge the status quo
Across all projects—OPPCA, CapComm, and beyond—I regularly challenge the status quo. I frequently discuss with my manager what the goal should be, what’s feasible, and what the simplest path forward is. If ideas touch development, I discuss them with QDs like Suraj and Pranith; if they relate to product, I work with Bharath and Daniel. I also keep up with current academic research, industry whitepapers, and conference publications to bring in new perspectives.
For example, the next generation of OPPCA will incorporate imbalance-triggered logic, consider late orders post-3:50 PM, and introduce velocity-based triggers (Δ imbalance / Δ time), allowing us to react to fast-changing conditions. In late VWAP CapComm, we’re redefining markouts to align better with flow dynamics and economics.
I view these discussions not just as internal innovation, but also as part of building an inclusive idea-sharing culture—where contributions from QRs, QDs, and Product are all valued and integrated. Ultimately, these inputs translate into better, more robust products for our clients and internal stakeholders.

===============
2 Values and Mindset

1. Challenge the Status Quo
For Opportunistic Close, CapComm, and previous projects—as well as in my earlier career—I’ve always challenged the status quo, because I believe that’s the only way to truly improve a product or a process. Even when organizational structure or team dynamics make it difficult to speak up, I still do, because it’s the right thing to do.
Almost daily, I speak with my manager Song to question whether current processes are optimal and whether an alternative approach may be more logical or effective. These conversations often extend to QD and Product teams as well, especially when I spot opportunities to rethink standard practices based on data, market structure, or statistical modeling.
When junior colleagues or peers come to me for advice, I share both well-established techniques and lesser-known insights that practitioners rely on but aren’t widely covered in literature. That mindset—challenging convention while staying grounded in rigorous thinking—is a core part of how I deliver high-quality solutions and drive innovation within our team.

2. Take Personal Responsibility
I take personal responsibility and ownership over everything I work on—whether it’s writing spec documents, delivering presentations to CRB, or collaborating with QDs. In OPPCA, I wasn’t just the research lead. I worked closely with Suraj and Pranith from QD to ensure implementation matched spec—not only through technical write-ups, but also through explanatory sessions that resembled a short lecture, helping align everyone on the problem, methodology, and expectations.
I consistently highlight risks, limitations, and concerns—sometimes before anyone else notices. This isn’t just risk management; it’s a reflection of ownership. For CapComm, I took initiative to present directly to the head of CRB, making sure he understood the logic and risk controls involved. While the Product team could have presented, I advocated for presenting myself to ensure clarity, credibility, and trust were established from the outset.
This is how I interpret Barclays’ advice about acting like an owner—and I aim to embody that in every phase of our research and deployment.

3. Inspire Each Other to Deliver
When colleagues reach out—especially junior ones—I approach the conversation as a blend of mentorship and collaborative problem-solving. I follow three principles:
Understand their thinking. I ask questions to help them articulate what they’ve done and ideally lead themselves to the answer.


Normalize uncertainty. I make it clear that not knowing something is fine. Pretending to know everything only creates barriers. My own success in theoretical physics came from being honest about knowledge gaps and working hard to fill them.


Leverage breadth of experience. Having worked across science, multiple companies, and asset classes, I can often spot analogies or solutions from entirely different domains that help a teammate crack a hard problem.


I’ve supported Yifan, new joiner Hudson, intern Claire, and many others across QR and Product. I often assist Ameya and Bharath with insights into buy-side practices, or help Suraj from QD think through microstructure-driven implementations. When Daniel or Krishan from Product hit statistical roadblocks, I’ve helped them refine their approach to get more reliable results.
I also encourage everyone to read more and think from first principles, because overreliance on data alone can be misleading—especially with small samples or biased signals. Combining theory with empiricism is what I try to foster in our daily collaboration.

4. Respect: Trust Those We Work With
There’s a balance between trust and ownership. If I’m the product owner, I check everything. But when work is shared, trust is essential. It allows us to scale more quickly and play to each other’s strengths.
For example, after reviewing a few examples in Hudson’s Closed Market Impact Model, I had full trust in his output. That allowed me to integrate his numbers into Opportunistic Close within a day instead of spending a week validating them.
Conversely, because I’m rigorous with my own work, others rarely feel the need to double-check my numbers—saving time and enabling fast, confident decision-making across teams.

5. Integrity: Operate with Honesty
Honesty and transparency aren’t just values—I see them as personal non-negotiables. They are part of my upbringing, my scientific training, and the foundation of my professional identity.
That’s why I always surface both positives and negatives in any project. I believe integrity is not just about being right—it’s about being clear, fair, and open in every communication. This is what protects long-term trust and credibility across teams.

6. Service: Clients at the Center of What We Do
The first question I asked during our initial CapComm meeting was: “How does this benefit our clients?” Specifically, I focused on how mid-price executions benefit clients compared to far-touch, and how CRB—as our internal client—also benefits.
Only after that did I ask how our team would benefit. That order of priorities reflects how I think about product design: externally facing first, then internally scalable. CapComm’s strength is that it benefits all three: the client, the CRB, and us.

7. Excellence: Set High Standards
I set high standards not only for my own work but for the methodologies and tools we use as a team. I stay deeply engaged with the latest innovations across statistics, machine learning, and trading research. When starting a project, I often ask: “Can we achieve more with a better tool or method?”
I sometimes run heavy data crunching jobs over the weekend so that analysis is ready Monday morning, maximizing the use of compute resources while keeping turnaround time fast.
More broadly, I’ve heard from various senior leaders that some VPs stop proposing innovation and focus only on assigned tasks. I’ve never operated that way. I maintain a list of innovation ideas and often just need a green light to adapt them to current systems.
This proactive mindset is why my partnership with Song works so well: he brings deep domain experience, and I bring forward-looking technical ideas. As I deepen my system knowledge, I expect to contribute even more—both laterally (scaling across products) and vertically (deepening core performance).

8. Stewardship: Leave Things Better Than We Found Them
Most of our work in ET involves improving existing frameworks—whether due to evolving client needs or legacy limitations. This means stewardship is naturally embedded into everything we do.
In past recalibration projects, even when we didn’t overhaul the model itself, we updated coefficients and adapted to new market regimes. In 2025, I’ve tried to be pragmatic—prioritizing feasible improvements while noting deeper innovations for future implementation.

9. Listen and Be Authentic
Psychological safety and open-mindedness are central to how I operate. Even though I’ve only been at Barclays for about 1.5 years, I’ve always welcomed questions from more junior colleagues—without any expectation that they already know everything.
I believe in being open about not having all the answers. When I don’t know something, I admit it and work to figure it out. This attitude builds trust and makes it easier for others to collaborate without fear of judgment.
Daniel and Krishan from Product, QRs, QDs like Pranith and Suraj, and interns across both research and product know they can approach me for candid discussions and realistic feedback.

10. Energize and Inspire: Set Ambitious Plans
Our team is guided by two excellent directors, but day-to-day execution often involves fine-tuned planning and iteration with junior quants. I aim to bring energy, ideas, and drive to every project—whether it’s solving a complex problem or brainstorming a better workflow.
My prior experience in large-scale modeling and scientific computing helps me propose enhancements that are both ambitious and grounded. Sometimes my manager Song has to ask me to simplify or delay certain ideas due to resource constraints—but even at 50% implementation, we often achieve very strong results.
Many teams eventually hit a plateau, where marginal improvements no longer move the needle. I believe my combination of hands-on innovation and deep theoretical grounding will ensure our team continues to evolve—both in terms of impact and thought leadership.
